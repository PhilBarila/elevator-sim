# elevator-sim

Simulates an elevator.  Elevator class simulates the movement of the carriage.
Controller class simulates the control panel.  None of the door interlock or any
other real-world safety considerations have been included.

### Would have been nice:
Parameterized tests.  It definitely can be done, but it was getting a bit messy, and I decided it
was beyond the scope of the project and elected not to invest any more time into figuring out
how to clean it up enough to be satisfied with it.
